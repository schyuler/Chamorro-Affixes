# Chamorro-Affixes

A program that modifies Chamorro words by applying affixes that are commonly used in the language. This will be used to create a tool for supporting language students to learn how to correctly modify root words. This will also be used to enhance existing Chamorro - English dictionaries to provide learners with more expanded reference materials.
